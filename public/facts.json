    "preview": "To achieve its look, Akira created 50 colors not found in other anime.",
    "fullText": "Akira wasn’t just a storytelling milestone—it redefined anime visuals forever. The creators developed 50 brand-new colors exclusively for the film, allowing for rich cityscapes, vivid lighting, and detailed character designs that pushed the limits of traditional animation.\n\nThese innovations helped Akira capture the gritty, neon-drenched atmosphere of a cyberpunk future. Its bold aesthetic still influences animation, fashion, and science fiction decades after its release.",

    "fullText": "In the early concept phase of My Hero Academia, Yuga Aoyama had a different hero name—Can’t Stop Twinkle. His character design also looked different, with longer, less spiky hair and a more flamboyant vibe that hadn’t yet been refined for the anime.\n\nAs development progressed, the name and style were toned down to better balance his quirky personality with the tone of the show. These changes helped shape Aoyama into the sparkly and awkward hero fans know today.",

    "fullText": "Before finalizing the story of One Piece, Eiichiro Oda had a different path in mind for Roronoa Zoro. Early drafts showed Zoro as a pirate working under Buggy the Clown, which would’ve placed him on the opposite side of the story’s main crew.\n\nThankfully, Oda changed course and introduced Zoro as Luffy’s first crewmate. That decision helped define the Straw Hat dynamic and gave fans one of the most loyal and iconic swordsmen in all of anime.",
