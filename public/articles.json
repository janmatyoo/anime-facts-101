    "overview": "Eiichiro Oda originally intended One Piece to run for only five years. The plan was simple, with a straightforward treasure hunt and fewer characters. But as the story developed, Oda expanded the world, creating deeper lore, richer character arcs, and more complex plots. What started as a short pirate adventure turned into one of the longest running and most beloved manga and anime series in history, captivating fans across generations.",

        "details": "When Eiichiro Oda began writing One Piece in 1997, he planned for the series to end in about five years. The original concept was much simpler, focusing solely on Luffy's journey to find the legendary treasure with a relatively small cast and linear story progression.\n\nHowever, Oda quickly realized the story had much more potential. As the world grew and fan interest skyrocketed, he extended the timeline to accommodate deeper plotlines, complex characters, and a richer lore that fans came to love.",

        "details": "In the early concept phase, Oda thought about including romantic elements, especially involving Nami and Luffy. He believed that a romantic arc might help humanize the characters further.\n\nHowever, he later felt romance would take away from the sense of adventure and friendship that defines the series. Instead, he focused on developing emotional bonds through loyalty, shared dreams, and personal struggles.",

Key parts of the conclusion, such as the nature of the treasure and the fate of important characters, have been set since the early days.\n\nThis approach allowed him to carefully place clues and build long-term mysteries, keeping fans engaged for over two decades.

These were added later as Oda developed a deeper narrative structure around the pirate world.\n\nAs he introduced new islands and lore, each arc built upon the last with increasing scale and depth. What began as a treasure hunt turned into a saga filled with wars, power struggles, ancient secrets, and ideological battles.",
