The original concept was much simpler, focusing solely on Luffy's journey to find the legendary treasure with a relatively small cast and linear story progression.\n\nHowever, Oda quickly realized the story had much more potential. As the world grew and fan interest skyrocketed, he extended the timeline to accommodate deeper plotlines, complex characters, and a richer lore that fans came to love.",
